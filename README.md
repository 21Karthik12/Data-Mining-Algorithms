# Data Mining Algorithms
This repository contains various algorithms used for data mining purposes. These include:
- Linear Regression Algorithm
- Decision Tree Algorithm Using Information Gain Metric
- Naive Bayesian Classifier Algorithm
- Support And Confidence Calculation Algorithm
- Apriori Algorithm For Association Rules
- K-Means Clustering Algorithm
- K-Nearest Neighbours Algorithm

All the algorithms have been written using C++. The datasets used for input in some algorithms have also been included in the "datasets" directory.
